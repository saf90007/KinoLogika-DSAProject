## Important Notice ##

Since we're currently short on time and have to submit this project soon, we can't figure out how to upload the entire project
by keeping our API Key a secret so we won't be uploading settings.py, a file that's necessary to run the progarm, to this repository just yet.

If you want to try it out, you could contact us on one of these emails to get settings.py so you can run the program.

# How to run the program

Once you have all the necessary files, navigate to the directory where all these files are are and simply run this in the terminal:
python manage.py runserver

Once the server is up and running, you can test out the website on your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
